# Identifying Brian Cell Types from Single Nuclei Collected from Methanol-Fixed FANS Sorting and Methylome Analyses

We processed the methylome data using [this pipeline](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_Interneuron/tree/main/Pipelines/Methylome)

We compared the sorted methylome with human single-cell methylation data from published literature [PMID: 28798132](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan3351) was downloaded, and reads from excitatory neurons and inhibitory neuros were pooled separately and used as positive controls. 

[Codes](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_Interneuron/blob/main/Methylome/plots/Human_Interneuron_Methylome_Plots.ipynb) for plotting the cosine similarity and hierarchical clustering of methylation patterns of gold-standard inhibitory neurons, sorted DLX1 positive cells, excitatory neurons, sorted TBR1 positive cells. And control samples from heart, cortical microglia, and cortical oligodendrocytes.
